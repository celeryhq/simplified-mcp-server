# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the MCP server to dynamically discover and register tools based on workflows provided by a `workflows-list-tool`. Instead of having static, hardcoded tools, the server will query available workflows at runtime and automatically create corresponding MCP tools that can execute these workflows. This creates a flexible, extensible system where new workflow-based tools can be added without code changes to the MCP server itself.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want the server to automatically discover available workflows, so that I can access workflow-based tools without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL query the workflows-list-tool to discover available workflows
2. WHEN workflows are discovered THEN the server SHALL automatically register corresponding MCP tools for each workflow
3. WHEN a workflow becomes unavailable THEN the server SHALL remove the corresponding tool from the registry
4. IF the workflows-list-tool is not available THEN the server SHALL log a warning and continue with static tools only

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want to execute workflow-based tools through the standard MCP protocol endpoints, so that I can leverage workflows seamlessly within my MCP client without needing special workflow-specific interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client calls `tools/list` THEN the server SHALL include all discovered workflow-based tools in the response alongside static tools
2. WHEN an MCP client calls `tools/call` with a workflow-based tool THEN the server SHALL execute the corresponding workflow with the provided parameters
3. WHEN workflow execution completes successfully THEN the server SHALL return the workflow results in standard MCP tool response format
4. WHEN workflow execution fails THEN the server SHALL return an appropriate MCP error response with failure details
5. WHEN workflow parameters are invalid THEN the server SHALL validate and return standard MCP parameter validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want workflow-based tools to have proper metadata and parameter definitions, so that MCP clients can provide appropriate interfaces and validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is discovered THEN the server SHALL extract tool metadata including name, description, and parameter schema from the workflow definition
2. WHEN the workflows-list-tool returns workflows THEN each workflow SHALL conform to the expected schema format with required fields: id, name, description, and optional inputSchema
3. WHEN tool metadata is incomplete THEN the server SHALL provide sensible defaults for missing information (generic parameter schema, default category)
4. WHEN parameter schemas are available THEN the server SHALL use them for tool parameter validation following JSON Schema format
5. IF parameter schemas are not available THEN the server SHALL create a generic parameter schema that accepts any object parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the dynamic tool discovery to be configurable, so that I can control which workflows are exposed as tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is configured THEN it SHALL support enabling/disabling dynamic workflow tool discovery
2. WHEN workflow filtering is configured THEN the server SHALL only expose workflows that match the filter criteria
3. WHEN workflow refresh is triggered THEN the server SHALL re-query available workflows and update the tool registry
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the server SHALL apply changes without requiring a full restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for dynamic tool operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow discovery fails THEN the server SHALL log detailed error information and continue operation
2. WHEN workflow execution encounters errors THEN the server SHALL log the error details and return user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN tool registration fails THEN the server SHALL log the failure reason and skip the problematic workflow
4. WHEN the workflows-list-tool becomes unavailable THEN the server SHALL handle the failure gracefully and retry periodically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized workflow schema format, so that the system can reliably extract tool metadata and create proper MCP tool definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflows-list-tool is called THEN it SHALL return an array of workflow objects with the following required schema:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "string (unique identifier)",
     "name": "string (tool name for MCP)",
     "description": "string (tool description)",
     "category": "string (optional, defaults to 'workflow')",
     "version": "string (optional, defaults to '1.0.0')",
     "inputSchema": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": { /* JSON Schema properties */ },
       "required": ["array of required field names"]
     },
     "executionType": "sync|async (optional, defaults to 'async')",
     "metadata": { /* optional additional metadata */ }
   }
   ```
2. WHEN a workflow object is missing required fields THEN the server SHALL log a warning and skip that workflow
3. WHEN a workflow has an invalid inputSchema THEN the server SHALL create a generic schema accepting any parameters
4. WHEN multiple workflows have the same name THEN the server SHALL use the workflow ID to create unique tool names

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want workflow-based tools to handle asynchronous workflow execution properly, so that I can work with long-running workflows effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow-based tool is executed THEN the server SHALL handle the asynchronous workflow execution and wait for completion before returning results
2. WHEN a workflow execution takes longer than expected THEN the server SHALL provide appropriate timeout handling
3. WHEN workflow execution provides progress updates THEN the server SHALL log progress information for debugging
4. WHEN workflow execution fails asynchronously THEN the server SHALL capture and return the error information in the tool response
5. WHEN workflow execution is cancelled or times out THEN the server SHALL attempt to clean up resources and return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want to check the status of running workflows, so that I can monitor progress and get updates on long-running operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is executed THEN the system SHALL provide a way to check the workflow execution status
2. WHEN a workflow status check is requested THEN the server SHALL return current status information including state (running, completed, failed), progress, and any available results
3. WHEN a workflow provides status updates THEN the server SHALL make this information available through status checking
4. WHEN a workflow execution completes THEN the status check SHALL return the final results
5. IF workflow status checking is not supported by the underlying workflow system THEN the server SHALL return appropriate "not supported" responses
