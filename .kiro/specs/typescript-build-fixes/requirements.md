# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TypeScript build is failing with 28 compilation errors that need to be resolved. These errors are primarily related to strict type checking with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`, missing interface methods, and type compatibility issues. The system needs to compile successfully without any TypeScript errors while maintaining type safety and existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript build to compile successfully, so that I can build and deploy the application without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL compile without any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate the dist folder with compiled JavaScript files
3. WHEN type checking is performed THEN all type assignments SHALL be compatible with exactOptionalPropertyTypes configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for optional properties, so that the code maintains type safety with strict TypeScript settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optional properties are undefined THEN the system SHALL handle undefined values correctly in type assignments
2. WHEN metadata properties are optional THEN the system SHALL define them as potentially undefined in interfaces
3. WHEN error properties are optional THEN the system SHALL allow undefined values in type definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing interface methods to be implemented, so that all service contracts are fulfilled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IWorkflowDiscoveryService is used THEN the system SHALL provide clearCache and getCacheStats methods
2. WHEN IWorkflowToolGenerator is used THEN the system SHALL provide clearGeneratedNames and getGenerationStats methods
3. WHEN Logger interface is used THEN the system SHALL handle child method availability correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate exports to be resolved, so that there are no naming conflicts in the module system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN createWorkflowStatusTool is exported THEN the system SHALL have only one export declaration
2. WHEN modules are imported THEN there SHALL be no redeclaration conflicts
3. WHEN the build system processes exports THEN all export statements SHALL be unique

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Timer type assignments to work correctly, so that cleanup operations function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting timer properties to undefined THEN the system SHALL accept undefined values for Timeout types
2. WHEN cleanup operations are performed THEN timer properties SHALL be properly reset
3. WHEN timer interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL allow undefined assignment for cleanup scenarios
