# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for DXT (Desktop Extension Toolkit) manifest generation and management to the existing MCP server. DXT is Anthropic's framework for creating desktop extensions that can interact with Claude and other AI systems. The MCP server will be enhanced to generate, validate, and serve DXT manifest files, enabling it to function as a DXT extension provider.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to automatically generate a DXT manifest file, so that my MCP tools can be exposed as DXT extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL generate a valid DXT manifest.json file
2. WHEN the manifest is generated THEN it SHALL include all available MCP tools as DXT capabilities
3. WHEN the manifest is generated THEN it SHALL follow the DXT manifest specification structure
4. IF the manifest file already exists THEN the system SHALL update it with current tool definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure DXT manifest metadata, so that I can customize the extension information and branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use custom metadata in the manifest
2. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults from package.json
3. WHEN the manifest is generated THEN it SHALL include required fields: name, version, description, author
4. IF optional fields are configured THEN the system SHALL include them in the manifest

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve the DXT manifest via HTTP, so that I can discover and integrate available extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /dxt/manifest THEN the system SHALL return the current manifest as JSON
2. WHEN the manifest endpoint is accessed THEN the response SHALL have appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN the manifest is requested THEN it SHALL reflect the current state of available tools
4. IF the manifest doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL generate it on-demand

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the DXT manifest to be validated, so that I can ensure compatibility with DXT-enabled applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manifest is generated THEN the system SHALL validate it against DXT schema requirements
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages
3. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm the manifest is DXT-compliant
4. IF the manifest has warnings THEN the system SHALL log them without failing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to map MCP tool schemas to DXT capability definitions, so that tools are properly exposed in the DXT ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP tools are processed THEN the system SHALL convert them to DXT capability format
2. WHEN tool parameters exist THEN they SHALL be mapped to DXT parameter schemas
3. WHEN tool descriptions exist THEN they SHALL be included in DXT capability definitions
4. IF a tool cannot be mapped THEN the system SHALL log a warning and skip it
