# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Simplified app. The MCP server will be written in JavaScript and packaged as an NPM package. It will serve as a bridge between Kiro and Simplified's API, allowing Kiro to access and utilize Simplified's functionality through the MCP protocol. The server will expose specific tools that can be called by Kiro to interact with Simplified's API endpoints, similar to the provided example but tailored for Simplified's services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Server Core Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create an MCP server that connects to Simplified's API, so that Kiro can interact with Simplified's services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is initialized THEN it SHALL establish a connection to Simplified's API.
2. WHEN the MCP server receives a request from Kiro THEN it SHALL validate the request format according to MCP protocol standards.
3. WHEN the MCP server receives a valid request THEN it SHALL translate it to the appropriate Simplified API call.
4. WHEN the Simplified API returns a response THEN the MCP server SHALL format it according to MCP protocol standards before returning to Kiro.
5. WHEN the MCP server encounters an error THEN it SHALL return a properly formatted error response according to MCP protocol standards.

### Requirement 2: NPM Package Distribution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be packaged as an NPM package, so that it can be easily installed and used by other developers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the NPM package is published THEN it SHALL include all necessary dependencies.
2. WHEN the NPM package is installed THEN it SHALL provide a clear entry point for initializing the MCP server.
3. WHEN the NPM package is installed THEN it SHALL include documentation on how to configure and use the MCP server.
4. WHEN the NPM package is updated THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide clear migration instructions.

### Requirement 3: Token-based Authentication and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want to be able to configure the server with my Simplified API token, so that I can securely access my Simplified account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the MCP server THEN it SHALL accept configuration parameters including the API token and endpoints.
2. WHEN making requests to Simplified's API THEN the MCP server SHALL include the token in the authentication header.
3. WHEN the authentication token is invalid or expired THEN the MCP server SHALL return a clear error message.
4. IF the MCP server stores the authentication token THEN it SHALL do so securely.
5. WHEN configuring the MCP server THEN the user SHALL be able to specify token refresh parameters if applicable.

### Requirement 4: MCP Tools and API Feature Support

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want the MCP server to provide specific tools that map to Simplified's API features, so that I can leverage Simplified's functionality through Kiro.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is initialized THEN it SHALL register a set of tools that correspond to Simplified's API endpoints.
2. WHEN Kiro calls an MCP tool THEN the MCP server SHALL translate the call to the appropriate Simplified API request.
3. WHEN a tool is called with invalid parameters THEN the MCP server SHALL return a clear error message.
4. WHEN new features are added to Simplified's API THEN the MCP server SHALL be designed to easily add new tools.
5. WHEN defining tools THEN the MCP server SHALL provide clear documentation for each tool including parameter descriptions and return value formats.
6. WHEN tools are registered THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention that reflects their functionality.
7. WHEN the MCP server receives a request for an unsupported feature THEN it SHALL return a clear error message.

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP server, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in the MCP server THEN it SHALL log detailed information about the error.
2. WHEN an error occurs in communication with Simplified's API THEN the MCP server SHALL provide meaningful error messages.
3. WHEN the MCP server is running THEN it SHALL provide configurable logging levels.
4. WHEN the MCP server encounters a critical error THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without crashing.

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want it to handle requests efficiently, so that I can use Simplified's services without significant latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server processes requests THEN it SHALL do so with minimal overhead.
2. WHEN multiple requests are made simultaneously THEN the MCP server SHALL handle them efficiently.
3. WHEN processing large responses from Simplified's API THEN the MCP server SHALL manage memory usage effectively.
###
 Requirement 7: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP server, I want to be able to configure the server using environment variables, so that I can securely provide API tokens and endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables.
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the MCP server SHALL provide clear error messages about which variables are required.
3. WHEN the MCP server is deployed THEN it SHALL support loading environment variables from a .env file for development purposes.
4. WHEN documenting the MCP server THEN it SHALL clearly specify all required and optional environment variables.

### Requirement 8: Tool Definition Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to provide a clear structure for defining tools, so that I can easily add new tools that interact with Simplified's API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining a new tool THEN the developer SHALL be able to specify the tool name, description, parameters, and return type.
2. WHEN a tool is called THEN the MCP server SHALL validate the input parameters against the tool's defined schema.
3. WHEN a tool executes successfully THEN the MCP server SHALL format the response according to the defined return type.
4. WHEN documenting tools THEN the MCP server SHALL generate clear documentation for each tool's parameters and return values.
