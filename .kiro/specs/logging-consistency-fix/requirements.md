# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has inconsistent logging that mixes structured JSON logs with plain text console output, causing "unexpected token is not valid json" errors when logs are parsed. This feature will standardize all logging to use the structured logger consistently throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all application logs to use consistent structured JSON format, so that log parsing tools can process them without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all startup messages SHALL use the structured logger instead of console.error
2. WHEN errors occur THEN all error messages SHALL use the structured logger instead of console.error
3. WHEN the application shuts down THEN all shutdown messages SHALL use the structured logger instead of console.error
4. WHEN CLI operations execute THEN all output SHALL use appropriate logging methods instead of direct console calls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to parse all application logs as JSON, so that I can integrate them with log aggregation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structured logging is enabled THEN all log output SHALL be valid JSON
2. WHEN the application runs THEN no plain text console output SHALL be mixed with structured logs
3. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include proper error context and metadata
4. WHEN the application outputs help or version information THEN it SHALL use stdout instead of stderr to avoid mixing with logs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility for CLI output, so that existing scripts and tools continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CLI help is requested THEN output SHALL go to stdout and not be structured
2. WHEN CLI version is requested THEN output SHALL go to stdout and not be structured  
3. WHEN CLI documentation is generated THEN output SHALL go to stdout and not be structured
4. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN console output MAY be formatted for readability
5. WHEN the application runs in production mode THEN all logs SHALL be structured JSON

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for logging operations, so that logging failures don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structured logging fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to console logging gracefully
2. WHEN logger configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use default settings and continue
3. WHEN log level changes THEN all loggers SHALL update their behavior accordingly
4. WHEN the logger encounters circular references THEN it SHALL handle them safely without crashing
